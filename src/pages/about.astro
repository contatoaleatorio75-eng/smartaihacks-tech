				<p class="text-gray-300">
					At Smart AI Hacks, we use the word "hacks" to describe clever shortcuts, productivity tips, and creative techniques to solve problems. Whether it's a refined prompt for ChatGPT, a workflow automation, or a hidden feature in a new tool, our goal is to help you "hack" your learning curve and achieve extraordinary results in less time.
