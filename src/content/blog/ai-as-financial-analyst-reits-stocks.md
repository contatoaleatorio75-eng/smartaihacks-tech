# AI as Your Financial Analyst: Analyzing REITs and Stocks with LLMs

Investing in 2026 requires more than just intuition; it requires data processing. For individual investors, reading through hundreds of pages of quarterly reports for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) or stocks can be overwhelming. This is where Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 become powerful allies.

## From PDF to Insight

One of the most practical uses of AI in finance is the ability to upload a PDF of a financial report and query it. Instead of reading line by line, you can ask your AI agent specific questions:

* "What is the current vacancy rate of this fund compared to last year?"
* "Summarize the management's commentary on future risks."
* "Calculate the Dividend Yield based on the current price."

## The Risk of Hallucination

While AI is excellent at summarization, it is not a calculator. In our tests, LLMs can sometimes make arithmetic errors when pulling data from complex tables. The "Hybrid Approach" works best: use AI to find the data and explain the qualitative risks, but always verify the specific numbers (P/E ratio, P/VP) with a trusted financial terminal or official source.

## Democratizing Financial Intelligence

Previously, only institutional investors had analysts to summarize reports. Now, with a standard AI subscription, any retail investor can have a "junior analyst" working 24/7 to monitor their portfolio's health.
