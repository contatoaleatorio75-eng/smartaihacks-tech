# The Battle of the Coding Agents

It's 2026, and the "Copilot" era has evolved into the "Agent" era. GitHub Copilot is now woven into every OS, while Devin has become a fully autonomous software engineer substitute.

## GitHub Copilot X
Copilot X shines in **speed**. It predicts your next move before you even type. For established codebases where you need to add small features or refactor, it's unbeatable.

## Devin 3.0
Devin is different. You give it a Jira ticket, and it comes back with a Pull Request. It's slower, but it handles the *entire* lifecycle: planning, coding, testing, and fixing its own bugs.

## The Verdict
*   **For Speed:** Copilot.
*   **For Automation:** Devin.

Use both. They are not mutually exclusive; they are the left and right hands of the modern 10x developer.
