**Introduction**

The publishing world has changed. You no longer need months to write a book or a publisher to sell it. Welcome to the era of the "Micro-Ebook"—short, problem-solving guides (typically 20-40 pages) that sell for $5 to $15. They are laser-focused on specific issues and provide immediate value. Here is how you can become a 24-hour author in 2026.

## Step 1: Research with AI

Before writing a word, you need to find a hungry market. Don't guess; use data.
*   **Tools:** Perplexity AI or Google Gemini.
*   **Action:** Ask the AI to identify "profitable, unserved niches in the [your interest] market." Look for specific problems people are desperate to solve, like "meal planning for vegans with nut allergies" or "coding interviews for self-taught developers."

## Step 2: Creation with LLMs

Once you have your topic, it's time to write.
*   **Tools:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet or ChatGPT (GPT-5).
*   **Action:**
    1.  Ask the AI to generate a detailed chapter outline based on the problem you are solving.
    2.  Feed it the outline and have it draft content chapter by chapter.
    3.  **Crucial:** Review and edit. add your personal voice and examples. AI works best as a drafter, not the final editor.

## Step 3: Professional Design

People judge books by their covers. Your Micro-Ebook needs to look premium.
*   **Tools:** Midjourney v6 or DALL-E 3.
*   **Action:** Generate a professional cover image. Use prompts like "minimalist book cover design, modern typography, [topic keywords], high resolution." Use tools like Canva to add the title text over the AI-generated image.

## Step 4: Sales & Distribution

You don't need a website to start. Use established platforms.
*   **Platforms:** Gumroad (easiest for beginners), Hotmart (great for Latin America), or Amazon KDP (massive audience but stricter formatting).
*   **Action:** Set up a landing page that highlights the *problem* and your *solution*.

## Conclusion

The barrier to entry has never been lower. With AI, you can go from idea to sales in 24 hours. The key is speed to market and solving a real problem. Don't overthink it—launch your first Micro-Ebook this weekend.
