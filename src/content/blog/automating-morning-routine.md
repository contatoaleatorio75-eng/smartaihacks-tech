# Waking Up in 2026

Imagine waking up not to a jarring alarm, but to your curtains slowly opening, the smell of fresh coffee, and a gentle voice summarizing your day's schedule and the weather.

## The Stack
*   **Home Assistant:** The brain of your house.
*   **Local LLM (Llama 4):** Running on your home server for privacy.
*   **Smart Plugs:** For the "dumb" appliances.

## The Workflow
1.  **7:00 AM:** Waking sequence starts. Lights fade in (2700K temperature).
2.  **7:05 AM:** Coffee machine smart plug activates.
3.  **7:10 AM:** AI reads your calendar and prioritizes your emails while you shower.

## Why Do It?
Decision fatigue is real. By automating the first hour of your day, you save your mental energy for the work that actually matters.
