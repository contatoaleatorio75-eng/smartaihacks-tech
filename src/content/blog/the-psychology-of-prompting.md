# The Psychology of Prompting

We often treat AI like a search engine: keywords in, results out. But in 2026, models like Gemini 2.0 and GPT-5 respond far better to *context* and *persona*.

## 1. The Persona Effect
Assigning a role to the AI isn't just a trick; it frames the latent space search.
*   **bad:** "Write a marketing email."
*   **Good:** "You are a senior copywriter with 10 years of experience in SaaS. Write a marketing email..."

## 2. Chain of Thought
Asking the AI to "think step by step" forces it to output reasoning tokens before the final answer, which drastically reduces hallucination rates.

## Conclusion
Treat your prompt engineering as a form of management. utilizing clear instructions, context, and iterative feedback to get the best results.
